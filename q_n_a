t doesn't matter that 5–15 ms per move would be very short for a real game move?

Not at all — for **self-play training**, that’s perfectly fine. In fact, it’s how AlphaZero-style training works:

* **Speed matters more than perfect play**. The goal is for the NN to **learn from millions of positions**, not to produce perfect human-level moves each time.
* Early in training, the network’s moves are mostly random anyway. Spending seconds or minutes per move wouldn’t improve learning — it would just slow down convergence.
* Later, when evaluating or validating the network, you can afford longer computation to get a “better” move for testing, but during **bulk self-play**, 5–15 ms per move is exactly what you want: fast, so you can generate thousands of positions quickly.

Essentially: in self-play, **quantity > quality**, and short forward/backprop per move is standard practice.


--------------------------------


If you want, I can show a **Node.js timing plan** for generating tens of thousands of games per day on your Mac with your current network size. It’ll give a realistic training schedule.

yes please

Great! Let’s break it down step by step for your Mac with **CPU-based self-play** for your 10×10 chess variant. I’ll estimate timings based on your setup and network size.

---

### **1. Average time per move**

* Forward pass + move selection: ~5–15 ms (as you mentioned).
* Backprop for one position: ~1–2 ms (small NN, single hidden layer).

**Safe average per move:** **≈10 ms**.

---

### **2. Average moves per game**

* 10×10 chess variant: games are longer than normal chess.
* Endgames may average **30–50 moves**.
* Opening/midgame: could be 50–80 moves.

Let’s assume **average 50 moves per game**.

---

### **3. Time per self-play game**

* Moves × time per move = 50 × 10 ms = **0.5 s per game**.
* Even if you include some overhead for game management: **≈0.6 s per game**.

---

### **4. Games per hour**

* 3600 s / 0.6 s ≈ **6000 games per CPU core per hour**.

---

### **5. Multi-core scaling**

* Your Mac (Apple M3) has 8 CPU cores.
* If we run one game per core concurrently: **≈48,000 games per hour**.
* In 24 h: **≈1.15 million games**.

> ⚠️ These are **optimistic estimates**, assuming your Node.js event loop and network computations scale perfectly. Realistic numbers may be 50–70 % of this.

---

### **6. Memory / buffer considerations**

* Store only minimal history per game:

  * Position vector: ~100–200 floats
  * Candidate move indices: ~5–20 integers
* For 1 million games, you’d exceed memory.
* **Solution:** store only a **replay buffer** of, e.g., 1000–5000 games, and sample minibatches for training.

---

### **7. Training strategy**

* **Self-play:** generate games fast, even if moves are not perfect.
* **Network updates:** after each game, or in batches of 32–64 positions.
* **Exploration:** use epsilon-greedy or temperature for move selection.

---

✅ **Conclusion:**

* Yes, 5–15 ms per move is fine.
* You can realistically generate **millions of positions per day**, enough for AlphaZero-style learning.
* Keep a **fixed-size replay buffer** to prevent memory blow-up.


--------------------------------------------------------------------


if a million games per day can be generated this way, why using gpus in the first place?

Exactly — that’s a key insight. For **small neural networks** and **low-complexity games**, like your 10×10 chess variant or even classic chess with a tiny network:

* **CPU self-play is often enough**. You can generate millions of games per day because the bottleneck isn’t the network evaluation — it’s the forward pass, which is very cheap if the network is small.
* **GPUs shine** mainly when you have **large networks** or want to **batch thousands of positions in parallel** for training. The forward/backward pass is massively parallelized, so a GPU can process tens of thousands of samples at once, which accelerates **gradient updates**, not self-play per se.
* AlphaZero used GPUs because its network was **deep and wide**, with convolutional layers over 19×19 boards. That network’s forward/backward passes on CPU would have been too slow for millions of updates per day.

So for your M2 and a small feedforward network, CPU self-play is actually **plenty fast**, and using a GPU is **not strictly necessary** until your network grows substantially.

If you want, I can estimate **how big a network would need to be before a GPU becomes worthwhile** for your variant.
